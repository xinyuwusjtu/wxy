Wireless Fingerprints Prediction for Positioning

Cellular network positioning is a mandatory requirement for localizing emergency callers, such as E911 in
North America. Although smartphones are normally with GPS
modules, there are still a large number of users with cell
phones only as basic devices, and GPS could be ineffective
in urban canyon environments. To this end, the fingerprinting
positioning mechanism is incorporated into LTE architecture by
3GPP, where the major challenge is to collect geo-tagged wireless
fingerprints in vast areas. This paper proposes to utilize the
subspace identification approach for large-scale wireless fingerprints prediction. We formulate the problem into the problem of
finding the optimal subspace over Stiefel manifold, and redesign
the Stiefel-manifold optimization method with fast convergence
rate. Moreover, we propose a sliding window mechanism for
the practical large-scale fingerprints prediction scenario, where
fingerprints are unevenly distributed in the vast area. Combining
the two proposed mechanisms enables an efficient method of
large-scale fingerprints prediction in the city level. Further, we
validate our theoretical analysis and proposed mechanisms by
conducting experiments with real mobile data, which shows
that the resulted localization accuracy and reliability with our
predicted fingerprints exceed the requirement of E911.
