Abstract
</h2>

<p>
The advent of social networks poses severe threats
on user privacy as adversaries can de-anonymize users’identities
by mapping them to correlated cross-domain networks. Without
ground-truth mapping, prior literature proposes various cost
functions in hope of measuring the quality of mappings. However,
there is generally a lacking of rationale behind the cost functions,
whose minimizer also remains algorithmically unknown.
<br>
We jointly tackle above concerns under a more practical
social network model parameterized by overlapping communities,
which, neglected by prior art, can serve as side information
for de-anonymization. Regarding the unavailability of ground-truth mapping to adversaries, by virtue of the Minimum Mean
Square Error (MMSE), our first contribution is a well-justified
cost function minimizing the expected number of mismatched
users over all possible true mappings. While proving the NP-hardness of minimizing MMSE, we validly transform it into the
weighted-edge matching problem (WEMP), which, as disclosed
theoretically, resolves the tension between optimality and complexity: (i) WEMP asymptotically returns a negligible mapping
error in large network size under mild conditions facilitated by
higher overlapping strength; (ii) WEMP can be algorithmically
characterized via the convex-concave based de-anonymization
algorithm (CBDA), perfectly finding the optimum of WEMP.
Extensive experiments further confirm the effectiveness of CBDA
under overlapping communities, in terms of averagely 90% re-identified users in the rare true cross-domain co-author networks
when communities overlap densely, and roughly 70% enhanced
re-identification ratio compared to non-overlapping cases.

Abstract
</h2>

<p>
Cellular network positioning is a mandatory requirement for localizing emergency callers, such as E911 in
North America. Although smartphones are normally with GPS
modules, there are still a large number of users with cell
phones only as basic devices, and GPS could be ineffective
in urban canyon environments. To this end, the fingerprinting
positioning mechanism is incorporated into LTE architecture by
3GPP, where the major challenge is to collect geo-tagged wireless
fingerprints in vast areas. This paper proposes to utilize the
subspace identification approach for large-scale wireless fingerprints prediction. We formulate the problem into the problem of
finding the optimal subspace over Stiefel manifold, and redesign
the Stiefel-manifold optimization method with fast convergence
rate. Moreover, we propose a sliding window mechanism for
the practical large-scale fingerprints prediction scenario, where
fingerprints are unevenly distributed in the vast area. Combining
the two proposed mechanisms enables an efficient method of
large-scale fingerprints prediction in the city level. Further, we
validate our theoretical analysis and proposed mechanisms by
conducting experiments with real mobile data, which shows
that the resulted localization accuracy and reliability with our
predicted fingerprints exceed the requirement of E911.

Abstract
</h2>

<p>
Fingerprinting localization systems are outstanding
for its convenient deployment, where a major challenge is the
high cost for collecting a huge number of received signal strength
(RSS) fingerprints. Mobile crowdsensing (MCS) paradigm is
cost-effective for large-scale data collection; however, a qualityaware
data pricing mechanism dedicated to MCSed fingerprints
accommodating practical application situations including budget
constraints and online data submission is still unavailable. In
this paper, we present a data pricing scheme dedicated to
MCSed fingerprints by enhancing the online learning technique.
We first reveal the principle of fingerprints quality assessment
for accurate localization. Based on the principle, we design
corresponding loss and regret function, reflecting the values of
the fingerprints with respect to localization accuracy. We then
present an online pricing scheme for MCSed data, which results
in that the worker’s payoff is a random variable following
an optimal probability density function (PDF) leading to the
minimum expected regret. Further, we extend our scheme to
application scenarios with different budget settings, where the
pricing strategies for the scenarios of regret minimization with
fixed budget and budget minimization for certain fingerprints
quality level are investigated. Experimental results are presented
to verify our theoretical analysis.
